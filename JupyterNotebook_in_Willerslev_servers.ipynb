    "In this tutorial I'm going to explain the solution I found to run jupyter notebook in the Willerslev servers remotely from by personal computer. I'm mainly based on [this](https://medium.com/@sankarshan7/how-to-run-jupyter-notebook-in-server-which-is-at-multi-hop-distance-a02bc8e78314) blog post which explains a similar problem. The different steps are shown in **Figure 1** and explained below. The idea is to create an *ssh tunnel* from a computing node (where your `jupyther notebook` is running) to the front-end of Willerslev servers (Step 1 and 2) and another tunnel from the front-end in Willerslev servers to your working station (Step 3) to open jupyter notebook in your computer browser (Step 4). I assume you've already installed jupyter notebook and all it's dependences and you know how to login to the Willerslev servers. \n",

    "\n",
    "1. Difficult to automatize\n",
    "\n",
    "I found a bit annoying to repeat all steps every time I want to work on jupyter notebook. I added some of the commands in my `.bash_profile` as aliases, but I'm not sure is the best way to automatize the whole thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Port uniqueness\n",
    "\n",
    "While port 1, 2 and 3 can be the same 4-digit number, if there are multiple users using the same ports in the same \"computer\" it's going to create some conflicts and errors. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Close shh tunnels\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, when I close the shh tunnels (Cntl+c or Cntrl+z), the process keeps running on the background, meaning that the port is still in use. Then, if I try to open again the tunnels, I get the error that the port is on use. To solve that, I kill the process that it's running that particular port with the following command"

    "4. ssh termination\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, when the ssh doesn't receive orders, it automatically closes down. This kills the ssh tunnel. To prevent that, I first run `screen` so that even when my session is killed, the process goes on and it does not stop my jupyter notebook while working. \n",
